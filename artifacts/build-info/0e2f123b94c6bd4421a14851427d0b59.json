If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\n * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.\n * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the\n * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says\n * \"admin cannot fallback to proxy target\".\n *\n * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing\n * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due\n * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.\n *\n * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,\n * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.\n *\n * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\n * inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\n * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\n * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\n * implementation.\n *\n * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler\n * will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above.

@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

@dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable by an admin.\n To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector\n clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two\n things that go hand in hand:\n 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\n that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.\n 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the\n implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says\n \"admin cannot fallback to proxy target\".\n These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing\n the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due\n to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.\n Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,\n you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.\n NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\n inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\n mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\n fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\n implementation.\n WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler\n will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function\n and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one.

constructor() {     _disableInitializers(); } ``` ====\",\"details\":\"This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

of the {IERC20} interface.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.

contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable by an admin. To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two things that go hand in hand: 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself. 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says \\\"admin cannot fallback to proxy target\\\". These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation. Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way, you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy. NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the implementation. WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This could render the admin operations inaccessible, which could prevent upgradeability. Transparency may also be compromised.\",\"events\":{\"AdminChanged(address,address)\":{\"details\":\"Emitted when the admin account has changed.\"},\"BeaconUpgraded(address)\":{\"details\":\"Emitted
